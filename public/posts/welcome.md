# Hello World
Welcome to my **yard**.

I'm the *Architect*. Well, I'm not an *actual* architect, but this was Seth *'Freakin'* Rollins' nickname at some point, and I like that dude (yes, I like Roman Reigns **AND** Seth Rollins. We do, indeed, exist).

Anyway, this space is where I share my work and thoughts with the world. It'll remain clean and *somewhat* minimalist.

Now what's a better topic to kick-off my cool blog other than my favorite mathematical function? (I'm proud of implementing *LaTeX* **AND** *Markdown* rendering **AND** I will not hesitate to use them for no reason)

$$
y = f(x) = e^x
$$

This little fella right there is responsible for no less than 85.45% -~~totally an accurate percentage~~- of mathematics and statistics.

Let's see..
- Normal, Poisson, Gamma, and Exponential distributions all have this number. They're all special cases of this grandiose equation: $$f(x|\eta) = h(x) \exp\left( \eta T(x) - A(\eta) \right)$$. If a distribution function can be written like that, it's called a member of the **Regular Exponential Family**. *The most prestigious family of them all*.
- Both $\int e^x dx$ and $\frac{d}{dx}(e^x)$ will equal $e^x$. It is the only function to have the derivative equaling its integral. Such a flex.
- It is the limit of growth: $\lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + 1/n)^n$. Which practically means, If you invest money at 100% interest and compound it more and more frequently (every day, every second, every millisecond), you don't get infinite money. You hit a natural "ceiling". That ceiling is our boy, $$e$$.
- It literally **defines the circle:** $e^{i\theta} = \cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta)$.

*Pretty cool, huh?* Go ahead, Google (or GPT, in this day n' age) even more uses of this *phenomenal function*. I'll wait here, *patiently*. Email or LinkedIn me with whatever you find. Let's bond over Euler's number, *because why not?*
